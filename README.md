# Matrix Multiplication Using Parallel Processing

## Overview

This project implements matrix multiplication using parallel processing techniques in Python. The goal is to leverage parallelism to enhance the performance and efficiency of matrix multiplication operations, especially for large matrices.

## Features

- **Parallel Processing:** Utilizes Python's `multiprocessing` library to distribute matrix multiplication tasks across multiple CPU cores.
- **Efficient Computation:** Handles large matrices and reduces computation time compared to sequential matrix multiplication.
- **Scalability:** Designed to scale with the number of CPU cores available.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `numpy` library
- `multiprocessing` library (included in Python's standard library)
